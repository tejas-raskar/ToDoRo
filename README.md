# ToDoRo: A Smart To-Do App
ToDoRo is a flutter-based smart to-do app that helps you keep track of all your tasks and helps you achieve them before the deadline. The main objective of this app is to help individuals like you and me reach our goals faster and efficiently while enjoying the journey along.

## Features
- Auto prioritization of tasks based on deadlines
- Built-in Pomodoro timer to boost productivity and focus
- Beautiful and intuitive UI design
- Cross-platform compatibility (WIP)

ToDoRo automatically prioritizes the tasks based on their deadlines. It assigns one of the following tags to each task:

- Urgent: If the deadline is less than 2 days away
- Upcoming: If the deadline is between 3 to 7 days away
- Leisure: If the deadline is more than 7 days away

This helps the user to see which tasks need their immediate attention and plan their work accordingly.
